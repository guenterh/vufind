[AutoSuggest]
enabled = false

; The following two sections control the behavior of the autocomplete drop-downs
; associated with search boxes.  The [Autocomplete] section contains global default
; settings, while the [Autocomplete_Types] section allows you to associate different
; autocomplete handlers with different search handlers.
;
; The available autocomplete handlers are:
;
; None
;       Do not provide any suggestions.  You should use this handler if you want to
;       disable suggestions for one search type while still providing suggestions
;       for other search types.  To disable suggestions completely, it is better to
;       use the "enabled" setting in the [Autocomplete] section.
; SolrAuth:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       See Solr below -- this handler behaves exactly the same, except
;       it uses the Solr authority data index rather than the bibliographic index,
;       and its default [Display Field] value is "heading".
; Solr:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       Perform a wildcarded search against [Search Handler], using the contents of
;       [Display Field] (a comma-separated, priority-ordered field list) as
;       suggestions and sorting by [Sort Field].  Any additional parameters at the
;       end of the string are treated as an alternating sequence of field names and
;       values for use as filters against the suggestion list.  All parameters are
;       optional.  If omitted, [Search Handler] will use the default Solr field,
;       [Display Field] will use "title", [Sort Field] will use relevance and no
;       filters will be applied.
; SolrCN
;       A customized version of Solr designed for smart handling of
;       call numbers using the custom CallNumber search handler.
; Tag
;       Provide suggestions from the local database of tags.
;
; You can build your own autocomplete modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/development:plugins:autosuggesters
